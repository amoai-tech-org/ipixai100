# SCREEN-REGISTRY.md — Canonical Screen IDs

> **This file is the single owner of screen numbering.** Every other doc (`DESIGN.md`, `PLAN.md`, `DESIGN-TASKS.md`, `todo.md`, `02-screen-map.md`, `docs/models/*`) references a **`SCR-xx`** ID from this table and **never** invents its own ordinal ("Screen 14"). If a screen isn't here, it doesn't have a number yet — add it here first.
>
> **Implementation handoff:** `docs/CLAUDE-CODE-HANDOFF.md` is the implementation-ready superset for Claude Code (per-screen specs, shared React architecture + build order, mobile architecture, Casting Review notes, AI architecture, Supabase verify-first, backend phases, verification checklists, readiness report).
>
> Rule: **`SCR-xx` IDs are permanent.** They are never renumbered once a screen is built. New screens take the next free ID; they do not shift existing ones.

## ⛔ Model booking — engineering override (2026-07-03, D1–D9)

**Supersedes the 2026-07-03 "folded into Shoot lifecycle" note below.** Per `../models/02-engineering-reference.md` (approved, reflects shipped backend):
- **SCR-21 Booking Wizard** (`/app/matching/talent/:id/book`) and **SCR-22 Booking Detail** (`/app/bookings/:id`) are **reinstated as real standalone screens** (prompt `11c`) — *not* folded away.
- **Two booking agents:** `model-match` (🟢 built — discovery/scoring/shortlist, never writes bookings) and **`booking`** (🔴 spec — draft quotes/messages only, D7). `production-planner` owns shoots, not bookings.
- **Shoot integration is narrow:** a `confirmed` booking upserts `shoot.shoot_crew`; Shoot Detail gets an **inline booking accordion on the crew row** — no Talent/Bookings tabs.
- **Contracts deferred (D8)** — no `booking_contracts` table, no contract/payment UI anywhere.
- **Status FSM:** `requested → quoted → approved → confirmed` (+declined/expired/cancelled), RPC-only, service-role confirm.
- **Agent chat = `OperatorChatDock`** (D9); `IntelligencePanel` = brand briefing only.

~~Booking is **not** a separate surface... (2026-07-03 fold note — retained for history, overridden above)~~

## Resolved numbering conflicts (2026-07-02)

The registry decides two contradictions that previously lived in `DESIGN-TASKS.md`:

1. **SCR-16 / SCR-17 double-assignment.** The §0 scorecard, per-screen completion matrix, and `changelog.md` all treat **Analytics Overview = SCR-16** and **Campaign Performance = SCR-17** — and both are **built + verified**. The Screen-IDs cross-reference's competing "SCR-17 = Role dashboards" **loses** (renumbering a built screen is worse than moving an unbuilt one). → **Role dashboards moves to SCR-25.**
2. **`D-NS6` used twice** (Campaign-perf drill-down *and* Role dashboards). → Campaign-perf keeps **D-NS6**; Role dashboards becomes **D-NS6b**.

**Model-booking folds (don't build twice):**
- Booking/talent **notifications → SCR-15** (the planned Notification Center), not a new screen.
- **Model & Agency dashboards → SCR-25** Role dashboards (they are two roles of the same screen).
- **Talent tab + Shortlist → SCR-09** Matching (4th tab + existing drawer).

## Follow-up edits to land the scheme (pending your go-ahead)

These are the only remaining doc edits to make SCR-xx the sole scheme everywhere:
- `DESIGN-TASKS.md` — fix the SCR-16/17 cross-reference line; split the duplicate `D-NS6`; point its Screen-IDs list at this registry.
- `docs/handoff/02-screen-map.md` — replace the "14–22" ordinals in the Model Booking section with the SCR-20…25 IDs above.
- `docs/models/00-model-booking-plan.md` — update §0.2 so Role dashboards = SCR-25 (currently says SCR-17).

## Mobile AI chatbot (platform-wide)

Every screen in this registry carries the **persistent, text-only AI composer** pinned above the mobile tab bar, plus a header **Insights** button (read-only intelligence sheet — kept separate from chat). The assistant is **route-scoped**: placeholder + proactive chips switch per screen/role. See the full route→assistant map, chips, verification matrix, and final audit in **`MOBILE-PLAN.md §22`**. **Voice/mic removed — Future Phase.** HITL always: no auto-accept/book/confirm/publish.
