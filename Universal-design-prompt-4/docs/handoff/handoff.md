# FashionOS / iPix — Design Handoff (Single Source of Truth)

> Implementation handoff for Claude Code / any coding agent. Built from the verified Claude Design prototypes (`*.v2.image-first.dc.html`). **Read this index first, then `12-production-handoff.md`.**
> Design language: **Zeely Editorial v3** — pure white / grey / black, Inter, black primary actions, image-first, a global AI chat dock on every operator screen.
>
> ⚠️ **Scope note — design vs. code repo.** This project is the **design** source (DC prototypes + specs). There is **no `app/` React code here** — "React vs Design drift" and production/`app/` parity must be audited **in the code repo**, against these specs (`09-react-implementation-map.md`, `13-react-mobile-verification.md`), not within this project. See `docs/design/DESIGN-AUDIT-2026-07-01.md` (R1).

## Coverage at a glance

| Area | Count | Documented |
|---|:--:|:--:|
| Screens | 11 | ✅ 11/11 |
| Shared components | 21 | ✅ 21/21 (EvidenceBlock added; reused on Brand Detail, Assets, Matching, Campaigns, Channel Preview) |
| User journeys | 8 | ✅ 8/8 |
| AI docks / agents | 5 agents | ✅ |
| Routes | 11 + deep links | ✅ |
| State types | 8 | ✅ |
| Mermaid diagrams | 12+ | ✅ |

**Implementation coverage: 100% of the prototype surface is documented.** The **AI-native runtime + backend contract** (agent↔workflow↔approval↔DB per screen, CopilotKit/Mastra/Supabase ownership, AI approval state machine) is scaffolded in **`14-ai-runtime-contract.md`** — columns are correct + grounded, exact schema/tool signatures are marked _TBD_ for Claude Code to fill against the live repo (tasks **RT-1..8**). Design-side performance budget: `docs/design/PERFORMANCE.md`.

### Canonical reusable patterns (apply across screens — do not fork)
- **EvidenceBlock** (`components/EvidenceBlock.dc.html`) — the single AI-explainability surface (score→potential, confidence, why, AI reasoning, evidence, suggestions, before/after, Approve→re-score). Reused on Brand Detail (per-pillar DNA), Assets (DNA match), Matching (creator fit), Campaigns (campaign health), Channel Preview (channel readiness). Spec: `AI-EXPLAINABILITY.md`. **Never build a second explainability component.**
- **Selectable + draggable cards** (D-DS5) — Select toggle + per-card checkbox + sticky bulk-action bar + drag-to-target drop dock, driven through each card's `onSelect`/`selected`/`border` props (no card fork). Reference build: Assets masonry; also Matching table, Campaigns grid. Spec: `PATTERNS.md#selection`.

## Source prototypes (canonical)

`Command Center` · `Brand List` · `Brand Detail` · `Shoots List` · `Shoot Detail` · `Shoot Wizard` · `Campaigns` · `Assets` · `Matching` · `Channel Preview` (`.v2.image-first.dc.html`) + `Pages/Onboarding.v2.zeely.dc.html`. Shared components in `components/`. Pre-v2 files are archived in `archive/` (do not use).

## Companion design docs (also source of truth)
