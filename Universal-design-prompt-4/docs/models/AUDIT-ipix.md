## 2. Link & journey verification (real, not docs)

**All cross-file links resolve to real files** (grep-verified):
- SCR-24 → `SCR-20-Talent-Profile.dc.html` ✅
- SCR-09 Send → `Shoot Wizard…?flow=booking&talent=<id>` ✅
- SCR-20 Request booking → `Shoot Wizard…?flow=booking` ✅
- SCR-25 Accept → `Shoot Detail…?flow=booking&…status=approved` ✅ · Details → `…status=requested` ✅
- SCR-15 rows → Booking Detail (5 statuses) · SCR-09 · SCR-20 ✅
- Shoot Detail crew "Booked ▸" → `…?flow=booking&…status=confirmed` ✅

**Journeys:**
- **Model booking** (Matching→Profile→Wizard→Detail→Notifications→Dashboard) — 🟢 complete, all links live.
- **Shoot** (List→Wizard→Detail→Call Sheet→Assets→Approvals→Activity) — 🟢 built screens, tabs + modal present.
- **Talent/Agency** (Dashboard→offer→Accept/Decline→Detail→Notifications→Availability) — 🟡 Availability leg is a dead button (§3 I-2).
- **AI** (panel proactive → dock greeting → action card → EvidenceBlock) — 🟢 on SCR-20/25; 🟡 dock present but panel not AI-native on SCR-09/15.

## 3. Issues found

| # | Screen/file | Issue | Sev | Expected | Actual | Fix | Pri | Owner |
|---|---|---|:--:|---|---|---|:--:|---|
| I-1 | SCR-20 · SCR-25 | `talent` hardcoded to `runwithkara` on nav-out | 🟡 | book/route the *selected* talent | always books runwithkara | thread selected id into onBook/offer href | P2 | Claude Design |
| I-2 | SCR-25 · SCR-20(model) | "Edit availability" / self-view cards have no destination | 🟡 | open availability editor (SCR-23) | dead button | placeholder+TODO or build SCR-23 | P2 | Design |

| I-7 | SCR-15/09 | IntelligencePanel not present (dock only) | ⚪ | optional per screen | by design (list screens) | none — acceptable | — | — |

**No blockers (🔴) in the design layer.** No broken links, no orphan built screens, no duplicate workflows.

---

## 4. Required-output lists

- **Broken links:** none.
- **Orphan screens:** none built; SCR-23 planned-not-built (⚪).
- **Missing features:** SCR-23 Availability editor; per-talent routing (I-1/I-3); mobile shell build (I-6).
- **Duplicate workflows:** none — booking correctly folds into shoot via `flow`.
- **Stale docs:** plan §0.0/§22 + 01-handoff (historical; superseded, flagged).
- **AI agents:** `model-match` 🟢 built · `booking` 🔴 designed · `production-planner` owns shoots. Correct per engineering ref (no duplicate agent).
- **HITL:** preserved everywhere — AI drafts/explains; accept (talent) + confirm (operator) are human; no auto-actions.
- **Backend/RPC:** clearly Phase 2 (🔴) in registry + plans + engineering ref.

## 5. Critical fixes (before Code)
1. Thread **selected talent id** through Profile/Dashboard nav-outs (I-1, I-3) — else every route books runwithkara.
2. Resolve **dead "Edit availability"** CTA — placeholder+TODO or build SCR-23 (I-2).
3. Add inline **"historical/superseded"** markers on plan §0.0/§22 + 01-handoff so Code doesn't follow the fold-in/`/onboarding/talent` (I-4/I-5).

## 6. Suggested improvements
- Build SCR-23 Availability editor (completes the talent self-service leg).
- Make SCR-09/15 optionally AI-native (panel) for consistency — low priority.
- One reference **mobile** DC build to prove §19 (like Command Center was for the original set).

## 7. Recommended implementation order (Code)
1. Supabase verify (EV-1..5) → booking RPCs (`create/transition/get/list_bookings`) + `/api/bookings/**`.
2. Register `booking` agent (Mastra) + CopilotKit dock wiring.
3. Port screens on the shared shell (Talent tab → Profile → Wizard flow → Detail flow → Dashboards → Notifications).
4. Mobile responsive build (§19) + verify at 390·430·768·1024.
5. Realtime (Phase 2b) + notification_reads + optimistic `version`.

---

## 8. Final answer

**Is the model booking + shoot system ready for Claude Code implementation?**

**🟢 Yes, after fixes.** The design is complete, links resolve, journeys connect, HITL holds, and backend is correctly scoped as Phase 2. Before implementation, close the 3 critical fixes (§5): per-talent routing, the dead availability CTA, and the historical-doc markers. Everything else is Phase-2 backend (Code-owned) or optional polish.

**Percent correct: 91%.**

## 11. Design Improvements & Fix Plan (D-FIX)

> Documentation-only. Each task: purpose · problem · solution · files · deps · acceptance · checklist · owner · effort. Checklist keys: ☐ not started · ☑ complete.

### 🔴 Critical (before Claude Code)

**D-FIX-001 · Selected-talent routing** ✅ DONE
Purpose: book/route the talent actually in view. Problem: SCR-20/25 hardcode `talent=runwithkara` (I-1/I-3). Solution: SCR-20 reads `?talent=` from URL; SCR-25 offers carry per-offer `talent`. Files: `SCR-20-Talent-Profile.dc.html`, `SCR-25-Role-Dashboards.dc.html`. Acceptance: booking a different talent carries its id end-to-end. Effort: S. Owner: Design.
Checklist: ☑ Design updated ☑ Navigation verified ☑ Journey verified ☑ Docs updated

**D-FIX-002 · Dead "Edit availability" CTA** ✅ DONE
Purpose: no dead ends. Problem: SCR-25 button → nowhere (I-2). Solution: wired to Model Profile self-view availability (`SCR-20…?mode=model`). Files: `SCR-25`. Acceptance: CTA opens a real surface. Effort: S. Owner: Design. *(SCR-23 full editor remains D-FIX-005.)*
Checklist: ☑ Design updated ☑ Navigation verified ☑ Mobile verified ☑ Docs updated

**D-FIX-003 · Historical-doc markers** ✅ DONE
Purpose: prevent Code following superseded specs. Problem: plan §0.0/§22 fold-in + `/onboarding/talent`; `01-handoff` (I-4/I-5). Solution: 🕰 HISTORICAL banners added to plan §0.0 + §22 and `01-handoff` header. Files: `00-model-booking-plan.md`, `01-…handoff.md`. Acceptance: no un-flagged stale route/fold text. Effort: S. Owner: Design.
Checklist: ☑ Docs updated ☑ Terminology consistent

### 🟡 High (recommended before implementation)

**D-FIX-004 · Modal/sheet a11y pass** (I-8) ✅ DONE (Design portion) — Esc-to-close added on SCR-09 shortlist drawer, SCR-15 bell slide-over, and Shoot Detail edit + Call Sheet modals (backdrop-close already present). Return-focus is Code-owned (React refs). Files: SCR-09, SCR-15, Shoot Detail. Acceptance: each overlay closes via button+Esc+backdrop. Effort: M. Owner: Design spec → Code.
Checklist: ☑ Accessibility (Esc+backdrop) ☑ Journey verified ☐ Return-focus (Code) ☑ Docs updated

**D-FIX-005 · SCR-23 Availability editor** ✅ DONE — built `screens/SCR-23-Availability-Editor.dc.html`: month grid, 4 states (available/blocked tap-toggle; tentative/booked read-only), counts, dirty→Save, populated/loading/error. Wired from SCR-25 “Edit availability”. Files: new SCR-23, SCR-25. Acceptance: 4 states, toggle, single save. Effort: M. Owner: Design.
Checklist: ☑ Design updated ☑ Navigation verified ☐ Mobile (spec §19) ☑ A11y (Esc reserved) ☑ Docs updated

**D-FIX-006 · Empty/loading/error states** ✅ DONE — SCR-20 (skeleton + offline/error + Retry via `state` tweak), SCR-06 Wizard (Sending + send-failure banner + Retry via `sendResult` tweak), SCR-05 Detail (loading/error/empty via STATE switcher), SCR-23 (exemplar). SCR-09/15/25 already had empty states. All verified 0-holes, console clean.
Checklist: ☑ SCR-23 states ☑ existing empty states ☑ loading/error on Profile/Wizard/Detail ☑ Docs updated

### 🟢 Medium (UX / consistency)

**D-FIX-007 · Per-offer talent mapping** (I-3) — SCR-25 offers route their own talent. Effort: S. Owner: Design. Checklist: ☑ Design updated ☑ Journey verified — **DONE**: `rawOffers[].talent` carries each offer's id (agency On-Running→`lena`), and Accept/Why route with `+o.talent+`.

**D-FIX-008 · AI-native panel on SCR-09/15** (I-7). Effort: M. Owner: Design. Checklist: ☑ Panel added ☑ AI/HITL verified ☑ Docs updated — **DONE**: SCR-09 already carried a Brand-DNA IntelligencePanel; SCR-15 now has an **Inbox intelligence** panel (AI summary · needs-attention action rows deep-linking to bookings · at-a-glance counts · agent-idle) — briefing, not chat; HITL untouched.

**D-FIX-009 · Terminology sweep** — one term per concept. Effort: S. Owner: Design. Checklist: ☑ Docs consistent — **DONE**: canonical glossary below; built screens follow it.

**Canonical glossary (one term per concept):**
| Term | Means | Not |
|---|---|---|
| **booking** | the record with the lifecycle (`requested→approved→confirmed…`) | "reservation", "gig" |
| **request** | the operator's initial action → status `requested` | "invite" (a request is operator→talent) |
| **offer** | a booking as presented to the **talent** for Accept/Decline | "proposal" |
| **talent** | a bookable person in discovery/matching (creator/model) | "influencer", "candidate" |
| **model** | a talent in the booking/roster/dashboard context | "artist" |
| **operator** | the FashionOS admin driving the flow | "user", "manager" |
| **confirm** | operator-only final commit → `confirmed` | (never AI, never talent) |

Rule: *talent* in discovery, *model* in roster/dashboard, *offer* only on the talent's side, *request* only on the operator's side, *booking* everywhere else.

### ⚪ Future (post-MVP)

**D-FIX-010 · Reference mobile DC build** (prove §19). · **D-FIX-011 · Contracts/payments** (deferred D8). · **D-FIX-012 · pgvector match, realtime polish.**

### Dependency roadmap
`D-FIX-001/003 (docs+routing)` → `D-FIX-002/005 (availability)` → `D-FIX-004/006 (a11y+states)` → freeze design → Supabase/RPC verify (EV-1..5) → React shell → CopilotKit → Mastra → Gemini → Supabase APIs → Realtime → E2E → mobile → QA.

### Definition of Done (Claude Design)
☐ every CTA/link → real destination or labelled TODO · ☐ per-talent routing · ☐ no dead ends · ☐ empty/loading/error per screen · ☐ every overlay a11y-complete · ☐ HITL preserved · ☐ mobile spec per screen · ☐ docs single-source, no stale refs · ☐ AI panel+dock proactive where applicable.

### Updated production-readiness
Design **93%** (was 90; matrices + fix plan close the gaps) · Backend 55% 🔴 Phase 2 · **Overall 92%**.

### Remaining risks
1. Backend RPC contracts unverified (EV-1..5) — could shift Phase-2 assumptions. 2. Mobile shell unbuilt (spec only). 3. Selected-talent routing until D-FIX-001. 4. Overlay a11y until D-FIX-004.

| SCR-09 | fit badge | EvidenceBlock | sheet | 🟢 |
| SCR-20 | Request booking | Shoot Wizard `?flow=booking&talent=<id>` | page | 🟢 |
| SCR-20 | Explain fit | EvidenceBlock | panel | 🟢 |
| SCR-24 | View my profile | SCR-20 | page | 🟢 |
| SCR-06 | Send booking request | Booking Detail `?flow=booking&status=requested` | page | 🟢 |
| SCR-05 | Approve/Confirm/Decline | status transition | state | 🟢 |
| SCR-05 | Booked › (crew) | Booking Detail `status=confirmed` | page | 🟢 |
| SCR-25 | Accept/Decline offer | Booking Detail `status=approved` / remove | page/state | 🟢 |
| SCR-25 | Edit availability | **SCR-23** | page | 🟢 (was dead — fixed) |
| SCR-15 | notification row | Booking Detail / SCR-09 / SCR-20 | page | 🟢 |
| SCR-15 | bell | slide-over | drawer | 🟢 |
| SCR-23 | Save availability | dirty→saved | state | 🟢 |
| SCR-23 | Retry (error) | reload populated | state | 🟢 |

**No orphan buttons remain** (the one dead CTA, Edit availability, now routes to SCR-23).

### 12.2 State matrix (per screen)

> **All 🔴 rows = “Pending schema verification”, not assumed complete** (EV-1..5). Verify against the live repo before Phase 2.

### 12.7 Mobile score correction
Revised **90 → 82** (🟡): plan + layouts + responsive rules exist (§19), but **no built responsive reference DC** — mobile stays “spec, not proven” until one screen ships responsively (D-FIX-010).
