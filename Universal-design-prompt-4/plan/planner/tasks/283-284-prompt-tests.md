Act as a **senior Supabase engineer, TypeScript architect, and QA forensic auditor**.

Verify the completed work for:

**IPI-476 · Planner schema & reusable engine core**

Merged PRs:

* **PR #283** — Supabase planner schema and reusable data foundation
* **PR #284** — TypeScript `PlannerEngine`

Repository:

```

Required skill:

```text
/home/sk/ipix/.claude/skills/ipix-supabase/SKILL.md
```

## Goal

Prove that the planner system works in realistic scenarios, not only through unit tests.

Verify:

1. Database schema correctness
2. Migration status
3. RLS and permission hierarchy
4. Cross-organization isolation
5. Seed idempotency
6. Realtime configuration
7. PlannerEngine correctness
8. Database and engine model alignment
9. Real-world scheduling workflows
10. Production readiness

Do not modify production data or migrations during the audit.

## 1. Inspect merged work

```bash
cd /home/sk/ipix

cat .claude/skills/ipix-supabase/SKILL.md

git status --short
git branch --show-current
git log --oneline --decorate -20

gh pr view 283 --json title,body,state,mergeCommit,files,commits,statusCheckRollup
gh pr view 284 --json title,body,state,mergeCommit,files,commits,statusCheckRollup
```

Confirm both PRs are present on the current branch.

Inspect:

```text
supabase/migrations/
supabase/config.toml
scripts/verify-rls.mjs
app/src/lib/planner/types.ts
app/src/lib/planner/engine.ts
app/src/lib/planner/engine.test.ts
```

## 2. Migration and schema verification

Run:

```bash
supabase projects list

SUPABASE_DB_PASSWORD="$(grep '^SUPABASE_DB_PASSWORD=' .env.local | cut -d= -f2-)" \
  supabase migration list --linked
```

Verify the planner migration is applied remotely and exists locally.

Confirm these enums exist:

* Planner workflow status enum
* Planner instance status enum
* Planner task status enum

Confirm these 10 tables exist:

```text
planner.workflows
planner.phases
planner.gate_conditions
planner.instances
planner.tasks
planner.dependencies
planner.assignments
planner.events
planner.view_configs
planner.notification_rules
```

For each table verify:

* Primary key
* Organization ownership
* Foreign keys
* Required columns
* Defaults
* Check constraints
* Useful indexes
* Timestamps
* Delete behavior
* RLS enabled
* No accidental public access

Produce:

| Table | Exists | Keys correct | Indexes correct | RLS enabled | Production-safe |
| ----- | -----: | -----------: | --------------: | ----------: | --------------: |

## 3. PostgREST exposure

Inspect:

```bash
grep -n "planner" supabase/config.toml
```

Confirm the `planner` schema is exposed intentionally.

Verify that exposing the schema does not expose data without RLS.

Test REST visibility using authenticated and anonymous clients.

Expected:

* Anonymous users cannot read planner data.
* Authenticated users only see allowed organization data.
* The schema is available to generated clients after type regeneration.

## 4. Permission hierarchy tests

Verify the hierarchy:

```text
owner > manager > contributor > viewer
```

Inspect:

```text
planner.is_assigned
planner.is_at_least
```

Test each role against realistic operations.

| Action                    | Owner |       Manager      |      Contributor     | Viewer |
| ------------------------- | :---: | :----------------: | :------------------: | :----: |
| Read instance             |   ✅   |          ✅         |           ✅          |    ✅   |
| Edit instance             |   ✅   |          ✅         |        Limited       |    ❌   |
| Create task               |   ✅   |          ✅         | Verify expected rule |    ❌   |
| Update assigned task      |   ✅   |          ✅         |           ✅          |    ❌   |
| Delete workflow           |   ✅   |       Verify       |           ❌          |    ❌   |
| Manage assignments        |   ✅   |          ✅         |           ❌          |    ❌   |
| Manage notification rules |   ✅   | ✅ or expected rule |           ❌          |    ❌   |

Do not assume the intended result. Read the migration and compare it with IPI-476 acceptance criteria.

Test:

* User with no assignment
* Viewer
* Contributor
* Manager
* Owner
* Service role
* User from another organization

## 5. Four-tier RLS forensic tests

Run:

```bash
npm run supabase:verify-rls
```

Inspect the planner section in:

```text
scripts/verify-rls.mjs
```

Verify that it does not produce a false pass when the migration is missing.

Create read-only or transaction-rolled-back SQL tests covering:

### Organization isolation

* Org A cannot read Org B workflows.
* Org A cannot read Org B instances.
* Org A cannot update Org B tasks.
* Org A cannot assign Org B users.
* Org A cannot create dependencies using Org B tasks.

### Role enforcement

* Viewer cannot mutate.
* Contributor cannot perform manager-only actions.
* Manager cannot perform owner-only actions if that distinction is intended.
* Owner can manage the complete instance.

### Assignment scope

* A contributor assigned to Instance A cannot access Instance B unless their organization role permits it.
* Removing an assignment removes assignment-derived access.
* Duplicate assignments are rejected or handled idempotently.

Provide exact evidence for every test.

## 6. Integrity-trigger tests

Verify these triggers:

### Bootstrap owner

On instance creation:

* Creator receives an owner assignment.
* Only one owner bootstrap assignment is created.
* Retrying does not create duplicates.
* Explicit owner assignments do not create conflicting duplicates.
* Cross-organization user IDs are rejected.

### Prevent cross-instance task moves

Test:

* Task cannot be moved from Instance A to Instance B.
* Updating ordinary task fields still works.
* A migration or service-role path cannot accidentally bypass required integrity unless intentionally designed.

### Dependency validation

Test:

* A task can depend on another task in the same instance.
* Cross-instance dependency edges are rejected.
* Self-dependencies are rejected.
* Duplicate edges are rejected or handled safely.
* Circular dependencies are either rejected in the database or clearly delegated to `PlannerEngine`.

State clearly which layer owns cycle prevention.

## 7. Seed idempotency

Verify the per-organization seed for:

```text
5-Week Product Shoot
```

Test in a transaction or safe test organization:

1. Run seed once.
2. Record workflow, phases, tasks, gates and rules.
3. Run seed again.
4. Confirm no duplicates.
5. Run seed for a second organization.
6. Confirm each organization gets an isolated template.
7. Modify an existing seeded template and determine whether reseeding:

   * Preserves user changes
   * Updates canonical values
   * Creates duplicates
   * Fails safely

Verify unique constraints support the claimed idempotency.

Report:

| Test | Expected | Actual | Result |
| ---- | -------- | ------ | ------ |

## 8. Realtime verification

Inspect:

```text
planner.broadcast_instance_change
planner_channel_subscribe
```

Confirm triggers exist on:

```text
planner.instances
planner.tasks
planner.events
planner.assignments
```

Verify:

* Correct topic/channel naming
* Organization or instance isolation
* Unauthorized users cannot subscribe
* Payload does not leak sensitive information
* Inserts, updates and deletes produce expected events
* Trigger failures do not block ordinary writes unexpectedly
* Realtime publication/configuration is complete

Check whether Supabase Realtime Broadcast authorization requires additional setup beyond the SQL policy.

Run a practical test with two authenticated sessions:

* Session A: authorized member of the planner instance
* Session B: user from another organization

Expected:

* Session A receives changes.
* Session B cannot subscribe or receives no events.

## 9. PlannerEngine unit tests

Run:

```bash
cd /home/sk/ipix/app

npm test -- --run src/lib/planner/engine.test.ts
npm run typecheck
npm run lint
npm run build
```

Confirm all 27 tests run and pass.

Do not report only the total repository test count. Report the planner test names and covered behaviors.

Review whether tests cover:

* Initial schedule generation
* Task duration calculations
* Task shifting
* Dependency propagation
* Multiple downstream dependencies
* Parallel tasks
* Cycle detection
* Missing dependency references
* Gate checks
* Role resolution
* Owner/manager/contributor/viewer ordering
* Empty workflow
* Zero-duration tasks
* Negative durations
* Invalid dates
* Repeated task IDs
* Deterministic output
* Input immutability

Identify missing edge cases.

## 10. Database and TypeScript alignment

Compare:

```text
app/src/lib/planner/types.ts
```

against the actual migration enums and columns.

Verify:

* Enum values match exactly
* Optional and nullable fields match
* Date values use a consistent representation
* IDs are consistently typed
* Database snake_case does not silently conflict with TypeScript camelCase
* Permission names match the SQL hierarchy
* Gate-condition operators match persisted values
* Task dependency representation matches the database model

Run or inspect Supabase type generation:

```bash
npm run supabase:types --linked
git diff -- app/src/types/supabase.ts
```

Do not commit changes during this audit.

Flag any mismatch between:

* Handwritten planner types
* Generated Supabase types
* Migration definitions
* PlannerEngine assumptions

## 11. Real-world scenario tests

Create integration-style tests or a safe script for these scenarios.

### Scenario A — 5-week product shoot

Create a planner instance from the seeded template:

```text
Week 1: Creative planning
Week 2: Pre-production
Week 3: Product shoot
Week 4: Post-production
Week 5: Delivery and approval
```

Verify:

* Phases are ordered correctly.
* Tasks inherit correct phase associations.
* Dependencies produce a valid schedule.
* Moving the shoot date shifts downstream tasks.
* Parallel tasks stay parallel.
* Final delivery cannot complete before required gates pass.

### Scenario B — Delayed model booking

Simulate:

* Model booking delayed by three days.
* Dependent fitting and shoot tasks must move.
* Independent tasks must remain unchanged.
* No task moves before its parent dependency.
* Updated dates remain inside or intentionally extend phase boundaries.

### Scenario C — Approval gate failure

Simulate:

* Creative brief gate is not approved.
* Shoot task cannot be considered ready.
* After approval, readiness recalculates correctly.
* Gate checks explain which condition is blocking progress.

### Scenario D — Role permissions

Simulate:

* Owner creates the planner instance.
* Manager edits schedules.
* Contributor updates an assigned task.
* Viewer reads the timeline.
* Unauthorized user from another organization attempts access.

Verify database RLS and `PlannerEngine` permission resolution give compatible answers.

### Scenario E — Dependency cycle

Create:

```text
Task A → Task B → Task C → Task A
```

Expected:

* Engine detects the cycle.
* Error clearly identifies the affected tasks.
* No partial schedule is returned as valid.
* Database behavior is documented if the invalid edges can still be persisted.

### Scenario F — Concurrent updates

Simulate two users shifting the same task.

Determine whether the planner schema has:

* Version columns
* Updated-at conflict checks
* Optimistic locking
* Last-write-wins behavior
* No concurrency protection

Flag this explicitly. A reusable planner will eventually need a defined conflict strategy.

## 12. Missing production concerns

Evaluate whether IPI-476 is missing:

* Optimistic locking/version columns
* Soft deletion or archival
* Workflow versioning
* Template cloning rules
* Audit actor fields
* Realtime payload versioning
* Time zone handling
* Working-day calendars
* Weekend/holiday scheduling
* Duration units
* Partial-day tasks
* Bulk task updates
* Database-level cycle prevention
* Maximum dependency depth
* Notification delivery implementation
* Schema-generated TypeScript types
* Integration tests against live Supabase
* Realtime end-to-end tests
* Performance tests for large workflows
* Indexes for timeline queries
* Explain plans for RLS-heavy queries
* Seed versioning and upgrade strategy

Separate:

* Merge blockers
* Required before planner UI
* Required before production
* Safe future enhancements

## 13. Performance checks

Create representative data:

* 1 workflow
* 10 phases
* 500 tasks
* 1,000 dependencies
* 100 assignments
* 2,000 events

Measure:

* Instance fetch
* Timeline task query
* Dependency fetch
* Assignment permission check
* RLS-filtered task list
* PlannerEngine schedule calculation
* Cycle detection

Use `EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS)` for SQL where safe.

Flag:

* Sequential scans
* Missing composite indexes
* Repeated RLS helper calls
* N+1 application patterns
* Engine complexity that degrades badly with workflow size

## Required scoring

Use:

* 🟢 `90–100` — Production-ready
* 🟡 `70–89` — Mostly correct; improvements needed
* ⚪ `50–69` — Incomplete or insufficiently proven
* 🔴 `0–49` — Unsafe or blocked
