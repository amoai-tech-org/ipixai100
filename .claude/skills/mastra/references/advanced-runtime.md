# Advanced runtime capabilities

Use installed embedded docs first; these capabilities exist in installed `@mastra/core 1.63.2`.

| Capability | Installed doc | iPix fit |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Code Mode | `docs-agents-code-mode.md` | Useful for multi-tool analytical/computational questions; optional, sandbox required |
| Dynamic Workflows | `docs-workflows-dynamic-workflows.md` | Advanced: user/agent-created workflow definitions; never allow consequential writes without approval/governance |
| Channels | `docs-channels.md` | Optional Slack/Teams/WhatsApp/etc delivery surface; application truth stays in Supabase |
| Pub/Sub | `docs-server-pubsub.md` | Useful when processes/services must exchange durable runtime events; not needed for ordinary request/response flows |

## iPix decision rule

Prefer the simplest primitive first: ordinary tool calls → fixed workflow → these advanced capabilities only when the observable product requirement justifies them.

Code Mode must run in an appropriately isolated sandbox. Dynamic Workflow definitions are data and must be validated, authorized, versioned, and human-approved before they can produce consequential domain writes.
