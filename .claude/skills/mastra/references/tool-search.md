# ToolSearchProcessor

Current Mastra reference: https://mastra.ai/blog/introducing-tool-search-processor

Installed `@mastra/core 1.63.2` is new enough for `ToolSearchProcessor`; verify its exact API in installed source/types before use. It exposes search/load behavior so a model does not receive every tool definition on every turn.

## iPix use

Not needed for the Core Planner's four deterministic tools. Evaluate only when a later specialist agent or MCP-heavy workflow has a large catalog and measured context/tool-selection problems.

Keep required safety tools/approval boundaries deterministic and guaranteed. Lazy loading is an optimization, not authorization.
