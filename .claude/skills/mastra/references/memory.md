# Mastra memory — docs & reference index

**iPixai Core:** thread-scoped **working memory** only (starter `weather-agent` until Planner lands). Do **not** enable observational memory, semantic recall, or multi-user threads unless a convert-plan ticket opens that work.

**Lookup order:** [`mcp-docs-lookup.md`](mcp-docs-lookup.md) → **`mastraDocs`** paths below → [`links.md`](../links.md).
